\subsection{Geometric Series}
Geometric series for $q \neq 1$:
\[
\sum\limits_{k=1}^n q^k = \frac{1-q^{n+1}}{1-q}
\]
For $\lvert q \rvert < 1$ the corresponding infinite sum converges:
\[
\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} q^k = \frac{1}{1 - q}
\]

\subsection{Derangements}
Amount of permutations of a set with $n$ elements such that no element is at its starting position.
\begin{lstlisting} 
der(0) = 1
der(1) = 0
der(n) = (n-1)*(der(n-1)+der(n-2))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Picks Theorem}
For every polygon with integer-only coordinates with following holds for the area $A$, amount of interior integer points $i$ and amount of boundary points $b$:
\[
A = i + \frac{b}{2} - 1
\]
Calculation of border points:

\subsection{Eulers Formular for Planar Graphs}
For every planar graph $G$ the following holds:
\[
V - E + F = 2
\]
