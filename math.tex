\subsection{Geometric Series}
Geometric series for $q \neq 1$:
\[
\sum\limits_{k=1}^n q^k = \frac{1-q^{n+1}}{1-q}
\]
For $\lvert q \rvert < 1$ the corresponding infinite sum converges:
\[
\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} q^k = \frac{1}{1 - q}
\]

\subsection{Picks Theorem}
For every polygon with integer-only coordinates with following holds for the area $A$, amount of interior integer points $i$ and amount of boundary points $b$:
\[
A = i + \frac{b}{2} - 1
\]
Calculation of border points:

For polygon area see the geometry section.

\subsection{Eulers Formular for Planar Graphs}
For every planar graph $G$ the following holds:
\[
V - E + F = 2
\]

\subsection{Combinatorics}
%TODO(Alex): Basic combinatorics
\subsubsection{Derangements}
Amount of permutations of a set with $n$ elements such that no element is at its starting position.
\begin{lstlisting} 
der(0) = 1
der(1) = 0
der(n) = (n-1)*(der(n-1)+der(n-2))
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Hypergeometric distribution}
Set with $N$ elements of which $K$ have a wanted property. The probability of $k$ elements having property $K$ when choosing $n$ is
\[
H = \frac{
	\left(\begin{array}{c}K\\k\end{array}\right)
	\cdot 
	\left(\begin{array}{c}N-K\\n-k\end{array}\right)
}
{
	\left(\begin{array}{c}N\\n\end{array}\right)
}
\]
\subsection{Newton Method}
%TODO(Alex): More information when to use.
The intersections of a function $f$ with the x-axis can be approximated iteratively:
\[
x_{n + 1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} 
\]
The method converges towards the solution quadratically therefore doubleing the amount of correct decimal places every iteration.
